# Graficacion


This repository contains several java classes with practices we did in the graphing class.

Basically, the subject of graphics teaches us how to model in 2D and 3D helping us in this case of JavaFx.
This allows us to expand our knowledge since we not only "know how to program" mathematical or logic algorithms, but we can also give it a different look with modeling, thus achieving a better interface between the program and the user.
